Python Diwali Sales Analysis
Hey there! Welcome to my Python project where I dived into some Diwali sales data. The goal was to dig for insights that could help a business boost their sales during the festive season.

What I Did
I used Python's powerful libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean the data, analyze it, and create some neat visualizations.

What I Found
The analysis revealed some cool stuff:

Married women aged 26-35 are the biggest buyers.

Food, Clothing, and Electronics were the most popular products.

The top three shopping platforms were Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart.

These insights are super useful for anyone planning a sales strategy!

Check It Out
You can see all the code and visualizations in the Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb notebook. To run it yourself, just clone the repo and install the necessary libraries:

Bash

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
Feel free to explore the data and let me know if you find anything interesting!
